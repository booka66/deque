Saving the talk reloads it. `deque demo/talk.deque` shows every feature.

## Format

| line | |
|---|---|
| `## text` | label |
| `# TEXT` | headline, block letters |
| `text` | centered line |
| `> text` | step |
| ```` ``` ```` | column-aligned block; ```` ```lang ```` highlights code |
| ```` ```sh run ```` | code that runs on a step, its output under it |
| `![label](file)` | picture; side by side on one line |
| `// text` | speaker note |

Inline: `**bold**` `` `code` `` `{accent}…{/}` `${ENV}`

| option | values |
|---|---|
| `fx:` | `wipe` `iris` `slide` `zip` `drop` `fade` `scramble` `assemble` `glitch` `typewriter` `random` `none` |
| `lines:` | `type` `glide` `fade` `scramble` `count` `none` |
| `reveal:` | same as `lines:` |
| `then:` | `shine` `pulse` `shake` `rainbow` `sparkle` `confetti` |
| `tr:` | `dissolve` `sweep` `curtain` `none` |
| `enter:` | command to run on enter |
| `cols:` | columns while `enter:` runs, with `--tv` |
| `draw:` | `WxH` canvas: `text` `center` `box` `arrow` `dotted` `clear` `step` |

Code in the same language on slides in a row morphs: what's in both glides to its new place, the rest fades. A slide's own `tr:` turns that off.

A `run` block runs in the talk's folder (`sh` `bash` `zsh` `fish` `py` `js` `rb`); a key stops it. Leave out the headline to give its output room.

`--cast talk.cast` is 100x30 unless `--size WxH` says; [agg](https://github.com/asciinema/agg) turns it into a GIF.

Options before the first `---` are defaults. Colors: `accent` `muted` `good` `bad` `warm` `link` `fg` `bg` (`#rrggbb`).

## Images

kitty, iTerm2, or sixel, detected; half-blocks otherwise. Force with `DEQUE_IMAGES=kitty|iterm|sixel|blocks`.

## Neovim

```lua
{ "booka66/deque", lazy = false }
```

`:DequePreview` shows the slide under the cursor. `:DequePlay` replays it.
